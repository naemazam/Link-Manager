# Link-Manager
Link Manager is full-blown utility not only for storing URL but also for finding the ones you want quick and with little effort as well as grab them from a specific web address.

Extra functionality is present in the application through some tools that allow shortening the link using a hefty list of services, converting the web page to PDF or running it through a translation service such as the one from Google. Another tool enables you to launch multiple web links at once.
